ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway

Relational comparisons (>, <, >=, <=) convert null to 0.

Equality comparison (==) does not convert null to 0; it only equals undefined.

This is a common JavaScript "gotcha."

Type conversion for relational comparison (>=):

undefined is converted to NaN when used in <, >, >=, <=.

Compare:

NaN >= 2 â†’ false, because any comparison with NaN (except NaN != NaN) is false.


(===) Strict equality â€” compares both value and type.



âœ… Copied by Value

That means a completely new copy is made â€” changing one does not affect the other

Non -Primitive Datatype==>Array Objects 

âœ… Reference (Address) is Copied

You donâ€™t get a new object â€” both variables point to the same memory reference.
So, changing one affects the other.
